<p>My name is Mary and I have been a part-time student at Cerritos intermittently since 2017. I am working towards transferring to a 4-year college to obtain a bachelor's degree in computer science. In the meantime, I work in customer support and I have been lucky enough to find a remote position, so I get to spend everyday working with my cat at my side. I currently have 3 cats and one dog. My career goal is to make enough money to afford a house with a yard that I can build a giant "catio" in. </p>

<p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> because I enjoy reading about different topics.</p>
